    Hi! I am Yizhe, a postdoc scholar in <a href="https://bmir.stanford.edu/">Stanford's Center of Biomedical Informatics Research (BMIR)</a>, advised by <a href="https://profiles.stanford.edu/nigam-shah?tab=bio">Nigam Shah</a>. Before coming to Stanford, I received my bachelor's degree (BSc) in Nursing from China and both my master's degree (MSc) in Biostatistics and my doctorate degree (PhD) in Population Health Sciences at the University of Utah. My advisors during my doctoral training were <a href="https://medicine.utah.edu/faculty/mddetail/u6013852"> Jincheng Shen </a> and <a href="https://medicine.utah.edu/faculty/mddetail/u0553599"> Tom Green</a>.
    </>
    <p>
    I am interested in causal inference, semiparametric and nonparametric statistics, and machine learning methods. I am passionate about applying advanced methods in statistics and machine learning to answer meaningful questions in biomedical research. My recent research has focused on the estimation of heterogeneous treatment effects in clinical trials or observational studies and identification of individualized treatment rules.
